#	 
#	 Element separators '|' . Note that they can't be used for values.
#	 Exactly one item required per element (NONE allowed if not required).
#	 Exact number of elements (4) required in every line, including NONE if element not required.
#	 Key value separators '='. Values ignored when NONE specified.
